## Summary
The advent of digitalization and the ever-increasing usage of Internet and its allied services have resulted in the mushrooming of risks, threats and attacks caused by malwares, thereby making computer systems and networks vulnerable. Malwares are software with malicious intent, built to wreak havoc. Though many antiviruses and anti-malware programs are available in the market, but most of them are based on centralized systems. This paper attempts to develop a novel decentralized and distributed multi-malware detection engine using signature-based and multi-Antivirus-based detection strategies. The proposed engine is based on the Blockchain Technology and has been developed for a single system or node in the network. It aims to classify the incoming Portable Executable (PE) files as either malign or benign. In case the PE file is malign, its corresponding file hash is added to the blockchain as a transaction. The node that broadcasted the file then traverses the chain to get the final verdict by performing a weighted average of the probability values added to the chain by other nodes in the network. The added advantage of such an engine is that it enhances efficiency for the low-end system which otherwise is incapable of performing heuristic scans; that generally require high-end resources.
